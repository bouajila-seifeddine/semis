Easy to use tools to help make your website GDPR-compliant. Fully documented, extendable and developer-friendly.

== Description ==

Easy to use tools to help make your website GDPR-compliant.

GDPR is a whopping 88 pages of legal text. Becoming compliant takes a lot more than just adding a couple of checkboxes to your forms! But worry not, we’ve got it covered. With help from [Triniti](https://triniti.eu), one of the top business and IT law firms in Europe, we’ve put together this plugin and written a thorough guide for making WordPress sites compliant with minimal effort.

You don't need to drown your customers in pointless acceptance checkboxes if you know what you're doing!

## IMPORTANT
The current version of the GDPR Framework fixes a ton of minor bugs. However, it's not yet compatible with WordPress v4.9.6. This will be added in the next major release. (Everything will still work, though.)

## IMPORTANT
IF you're using a caching plugin, please make sure you exclude the Privacy Tools page from your cache. Otherwise, it won't work!

## Disclaimer
Using The GDPR Framework does NOT guarantee compliance to GDPR. This plugin gives you general information and tools, but is NOT meant to serve as complete compliance package. Compliance to GDPR is risk-based ongoing process that involves your whole business. Codelight is not eligible for any claim or action based on any information or functionality provided by this plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Help, the identification emails are not sent! =
The GDPR Framework uses the exact same mechanism for sending emails as the rest of your WordPress site. Please test if your site sends out emails at all using the Forgot Password form, for example.
If you get the forgot password email but not the identification email, please make a post in the support forums.

= Help, the link in the identification email doesn't work! =
Are you using SendGrid or another email delivery service? This might corrupt the link in the email.
In case you're using Sendgrid, make sure to turn off "click tracking". Otherwise, please post in the support forum!

= Help, the Privacy Tools page acts weirdly or always displays the "link expired" message! =
Check if you're using any caching plugins. If yes, then make sure the Privacy Tools page is excluded.
Also check if a server side cache is enabled by your web host.

= How is this plugin different from the tools in WordPress v4.9.6? =
WordPress 4.9.6 provides tools to allow administrators to manually handle GDPR requests. However, the GDPR framework allows visitors to automatically download and export data to reduce administrative work load.
In addition to that, we provide tools to manage and track custom consent types and also a privacy policy generator.
We are also planning to add other important privacy-related features missing from WordPress core over time.

= What about cookies? =
This is a very important aspect of GDPR which we will definitely find a solution for. We are currently working on it and will hopefully have something before May 25th.
